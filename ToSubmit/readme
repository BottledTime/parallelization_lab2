To compile our code, you can simply used the supplied Makefile by typing:
make

This will compile the client and 4 server implementations. If you would like
to compile these yourself without the Makefile, you can do as follows:

Compile the client:
gcc -o client MultiClient.c -g -Wall -lpthread

Compile the server with a single mutex for the array:
gcc -o mtx_server mtx_MultiServer.c -g -Wall -lpthread

Compile the server with a mutex for each element of the array:
gcc -o mtx_foreach_server mtx_foreach_MultiServer.c -g -Wall -lpthread

Compile the server with a read-write lock for each element of the array:
gcc -o rw_foreach_server rw_foreach_MultiServer.c -g -Wall -lpthread

Compile the server with a single read-write lock for the array:
gcc -o rw_server rw_MultiServer.c -g -Wall -lpthread

All of these programs are called with 2 commandline arguments. The first is the
port number that the server is on. The second is the size of the server's array.
